# Hello there! 😊 I'm Gloria Wanyaga — aka kira8ke

### 🙋‍♀️ About Me
I'm a curious, hands-on tech enthusiast passionate about building systems that are smart, secure, and scalable.  
Currently diving deep into DevSecOps, Cloud, and AIOps — while advocating for inclusive tech communities and cybersecurity awareness.

🚗 When I’m not debugging code, I’m probably geeking out over turbochargers and torque curves.  
I like my code like I like my cars — **clean, efficient, and fast**.
